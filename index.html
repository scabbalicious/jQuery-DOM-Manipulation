				<div class="words"><p>So I spent at least 10 minutes trying to find placeholder text to go in this spot for this assignment. I searched on wikipedia for some really interesting text related to Rick and Morty. I also went on Reddit to find some wrestling-related content that might be fun and worthy of posting in this space. But I kept running into several problems. For one, a lot of the content has hyperlinks. Trying to copy and paste that kind of text can lead to formatting problems and its just not worth the effort. Also, some content just wasn't more than 2 paragraphs, and this assignment calls for at least 3 paragraphs worth of content.</p>

		<div class="section2">
			<h2 class="header">Section Two</h2>
				<div class="words"><p>And then I realized that I was just procrastinating on the assignment. I was trying to find the perfect text when that wasn't the purpose. I was just looking up cool memes, reading wrestling news and trying to see what's going on with Rick and/or Morty.</p>
				</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section3">
			<h2 class="header">Section Three</h2>
				<div class="words"><p>And it also occurred to me that the content for these paragraphs wasn't important at all. I could just as easily talk about finding content for these paragraphs. And that would be content in itself. How meta is that! And now I've reached the end of my paragraphs and have no more excuses for not trying to fix my CSS transitions.</p>
